# 📊 Indian Stock Market Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains materials and calculations related to the analysis of the Indian stock market based on **NIFTY 50** index constituents.
The project focuses on computing logarithmic returns, estimating risk and expected returns and constructing a **Pareto-optimal portfolio**, followed by an evaluation of its actual performance over a specified investment horizon.

The project was completed as part of an academic course on *Mathematical modeling of stock market*.
